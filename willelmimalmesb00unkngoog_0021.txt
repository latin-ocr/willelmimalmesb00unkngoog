His history has been compared to a drama,
in which the story is presented entire, though
the tediousness of continued narrationis avoided.
He dedicated his labours to his friend and patron
Robert earl of Gloucester, the natural son of
King Henry the First. This eminent person
appears to have possessed great legislative and
military talents, and to have been much at-
tached to literature. He seems to have acted
only from the purest principles of justice and
duty, without pride, passion, or selfish ambi-
tion. Had he aspired to the throne when the
nation had grown tired of Matilda and Ste-
phen, he might possibly have gained it3 but he
chose rather to preserve his fidelity and honour
inviolate. At the conclusion of the ‘ Gesta
Regum,’ Malmesbury thus addresses him: ‘ So
devoted are you to literature, that, though
distracted by such a mass of busineSS, you yet
snatch some hours to yourself, for the purpose
either of reading, or of hearing otherS. J ustly
do you regulate your exalted rank in life, neither

‘ omitting the toils of war for literature, nor con-

temning literature, as some do, for military ser-
vice. Here, also, the excess of your learning
appears 3 for, whilst you love bookS‚ you manifest
how deeply you have drunk of the stream. Many
things are eagerly desired when not possessed;
but no person will love philosophy, who shall not
have thoroughly imbibed it.'
