defect in the plan pnrsued by Malmesbury in his
History,-—a fault of design rather than of inad-
vertence. Fearful lest his work should assume the
character of a chronicle, he fell into the opposite
extreme, and frequently relatoe circumstances
without stating the exact year in which they
occurred. He did this either in imitation of the
Roman writers, or for the purpose of avoidiug
the difficulty of fixing each transaction to a par-

derived his information. It was not the custom

year was commenced on the ffith of March3 but
at worcester, and the monasteries founded by
Osuuald, it was considered to begin on the 25th
of December: thuS, transactions that occurred
between Christmas-day and Lady—day are fre-

ChronicleS, referred 'to different yearS. The
chronology of Asser, in his Life of Aelfred the

year, at other times in a different year. Aethel-
weard affixes dates to the commencement and
termination of the reigns os many of the Saxon
monarchs different from those assigned in the
Saxon ChronicleS. These writerS, taking as the
