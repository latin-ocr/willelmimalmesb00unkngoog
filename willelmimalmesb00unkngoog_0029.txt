considerably greater number of errors than are
to be found in the London edition, though the
Frankfort edition professes to embody in the
text the corrections made in the table of errata
of the London edition.
presentem· The text of the present edition has been taken
'¹' from a MS. written towards the close of the
twelfth century, which formerly belonged to the
abbey of Margan, founded by Robert earl of
Gloucester, the nobleman to whom M almes-
bury dedicated his work. This magnificent MS.
now preserved among the Royal manuscripts in
the British Museum, (Bibl. Reg. 13. D. 11.) was
selected, after a careful examination and com·
parison with other manuscriptS, because it was
sound not only to be the least corrupted, but
to contain proofs of the author’s latest correc-
tionS. The only other MS. which agrees with
the Royal Manuscript, though not so ancient by
some centurieS, is in the collection of Sir Thomas
Phillipps, Bart. From the various readings,
and from many important alterations observable
throughout, it is certain that th‘e author made
several corrections in his work after he had com-
pleted it; and it is believed that traces may be
sound of at least four distinct classes of copies of
the ‘ Gesta Regum Anglorum,' and of two of the
‘Historia Novella.' No one can examine the
- various readings in the soot-notes of this edition
without coming to the conclusion that the author
was constantly employed in the correction and
amplification os his work. Many of his alter—
ationS, it is true, are merely verba13 but they
contribute greatly to the elegance os his dic-
tion. In some places severe expressions are mo-
dified and sostened, whole passages are added,
