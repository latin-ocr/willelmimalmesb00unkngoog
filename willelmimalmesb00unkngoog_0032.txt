PREFAGE. XXV

the MSS. above mentioned, it has not been
thought necessary to refer to them.

This seems to be the fittest place to state, that, numu
in the marginal and foot noteS, the most ap- 32¹4&
proved orthography ofAnglo-Saxon proper names
has been adopted3 a plan which appeared to the
Editor the most advisable, in consequence of the

been compiled with much-care 'and talent byMr.
Fehon, will be found all the modes of spelling
proper names reduced to uniformity, 'and ar-

orthography. It should be also stated ‘that the
Index forms a good digest of the work itself.
Of the Notes generally it may be sufficient to
observe, that they have only been introduced
when the meaning of the author did not appear
to be sufficiently obviouS, and required expla-
