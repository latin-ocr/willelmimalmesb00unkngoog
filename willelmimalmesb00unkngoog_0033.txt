rected. When dates have been introduced in
the margin which did not occur in the text, a
note stating the authority has generally been
given.

It may possibly be thought that the present
edition is overburthened with notes ; but it must
be remembered that the peculial· plan of Malmes-
bury’s History in many cases renders some com-

κ little has been done that will not either elucidate

the author’s meaning, or save the reader the
trouble of referring to works not always at hand.
In every instance it is believed that the authority
for the statement given is derived either from
contemporaneous sourceS, or from the best ac-
cessible authority.

The Editor cannot close these prefatory re-
marks without returning his thanks to those
friends who have assisted him during the pro-
gress of this work through the press; but more
particularly to Sir Harris NicolaS, G.c.M.G.‚
and to John HolmeS, Esq. of the British Mu-
seum. To Sir Thomas Phillipps, Bart. not only
are the Editor’s thanks especially due, but those
alsQof the English Historical society, he having
kindly lent several valuable MSS. of Malmes-
bury to the Editor, for the purpose of collation.
From Mr. Samuel Bentley it would be unjust to
withhold a public acknowledgement of the very
great advantage this work has derived from the
skill and assiduity of his establishment: those
only who have been engaged in passing a similar
work through the press can adequately appre-
ciate the services for which an editor may be
indebted to the vigilance and sagacity of the

printer.
