be silent of Aethelweard, a noble and illustrious
man, who attempted to render these chronicles
into Latin3 his object Ι could applaud, if his
style did not disgust. Nor have Ι forgotten
Eadmer's work, written in temperate graceful
language, in which he takes a cursory glauce at
the times from Eadgar to William the First;
and thence, taking a wider field, brings his co-
pious and usesul history down to the death of “
Archbishop Anselm.¹ So that, from the time of
Beda, there is a period of two hundred and
twenty—three years of which there is no history:
thus the regular series of time halts in the
middle, from want of a connected relation:
Wherefore, as well out of love of my country as
out of respect to those who have enjoined me to
the undertaking, Ι have been induced to fill up
the chasm, seasoning my crude materials with
Roman salt3 and, that my design may proceed
with greater regularity, I shall cull somewhat
from Beda, to whom Ι must often refer, glaucing
at some few thingS, but omitting more.'

The principal sources from which Malmesbury
derived his History may be divided into three

as Gildas, Nennius, Beda, the Saxon Chronicle,
Saxon LaWS, Asser, Aethelweard, Eadmer‚ Os*
berne, Gosceline, Hariulf, and other earlier
writers, original charters, letterS, and official
documentS. ²
