He appears in early life to have shown an ear-
nest love of study3 and in the preface to his
second book, where he gives a brief account of
his youth, he observes— ‘ For a long time past,
thanks to my parents’ care and my own dili· ‘
gence, I have been habituated to reading3 a pur-
suit which had charms for me from my very
childhood, and with my years I have found its
attractions increase. In fact, my father brought
me up to think that if I directed my attention
to other pursuitS, it would be a waste of life,
and a hazard of reputation. Accordingly, I pre-
vailed on myself, young as I waS‚ to acquire a
taste for that for which I could not, with credit
to myself, show a distaste! He then proceeds
to state that he was orally instructed in logio,
that he had devoted himself somewhat more
closely to physic, and that he studied ethics in
detail, which led him naturally to the cultivation
of history. His labours in this last study he
thus describes :—‘ Accordingly, after I had accu-
mulated‚ at my own expense, various histories
of foreign nationS‚ I proceeded, as my* leisure
permitted, to inquire whether any records of
my own nation worth transmitting to posterity
could be found3 for, not being content with the
writings of antiquity, Ι myself became possessed

the time of Henry’ s death, and thor of a history upon which
would of course place his own the first critics of modern times
birth about 1'095 or 1096! Such have pronounced the highest en-

ficient ground for fixing on either ceeded his maj0rity at the time
of those years for Malmesbury’s when 'he commenced and had
birth. The assumption that King even finished the greater portion
