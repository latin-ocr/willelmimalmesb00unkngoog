The manuscript from which Savile’s edition
was printed was either carelessly transcribed, or
the volume was incorrectly printed: the text
abounds with gross errorS, which the table of
errata printed at the end of the work very inade-

the margin, it is evident that Savile consulted
more than one manuscript: but instead of having
followed any one in particular, he seems to have
formed his text from several. The present
Editor has not met with any manuscript which
entirely agrees with Savile's text: the Royal
MS. in the British Museum, 13. B. XIX. comes
nearest to it, but does not thoroughly ,agree
with it. Savile has no authority for dividing
his work into chapters} but his sections are
